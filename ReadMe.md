# A to-do list powered by vanilla JavaScript
The challenge here was to build a simple to-do list app in which a user can add items,
mark items as complete and ultimately delete items from the list. 

There is  a basic scaffolding for the project built in HTML and styled with an external
style sheet but the heart of the app and it's internal HTML structure are built dynamically
generated with and deleted by JavaScript. 

The main JavaScript tools used in this project are .forEach(), .map(), and .filter().
